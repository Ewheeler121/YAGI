# SDAS (Primary Branch)
SDAS stands for SP649's Distro App Store and is a GUI (might change). It is mainly made for Gentoo but will support Debian, Fedora, Arch, and Arch-based distros sometime in the future. The 1st version will only support Gentoo for now. It is just a hobby project nothing big. It will be able to use sudo or doas but right now it will only support sudo. Every release/archive will get its own branch while the current development will get the main branch. Also, it is made in C++ (might change later but prob not). This program doesn't manage use-flags but simply makes an easy way to install and uninstall packages. 
```
Dependencies/Requirements (As of right now):
1. Sudo
2. Gentoo
3. Xorg (idk about wayland but it might work)
```
