# YAGI (in dev)
A GUI (coming soon) for gentoo and arch but I might add support for other distros later. Also this is just a small project to try C.
 (Does NOT manage useflags for you!)
```
Dependencies/Requirements (As of right now):
1. Sudo/Doas
2. Gentoo/Arch 
3. Xorg (idk about wayland but it might work w/ xwayland)
```
