# SDAS
SDAS stands for SP649's Distro App Store and is a CLI (might change) where you can get used to the CLI. It is mainly made for Gentoo but will support Debian, Fedora, Arch, and Arch based distros. The 1st version will only support Gentoo for now. It is just a hobby project nothing big. It will be able to use sudo or doas but right now it will only support sudo. Every release will get its own brach while the current development will get the main branch. 
```
Dependencies (As of right now):
1. Sudo
2. Gentoo
```
